Getting started with Angular

Welcome to Angular!

This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Angular by walking you through building an e-commerce site with a catalog, shopping cart, and check-out form.

To help you get started right away, this tutorial uses a ready-made application that you can examine and modify interactively on StackBlitz â€”without having to set up a local work environment. StackBlitz is a browser-based development environment where you can create, save, and share projects using a variety of technologies.
Prerequisites

To get the most out of this tutorial you should already have a basic understanding of the following.

    HTML
    JavaScript
    TypeScript

Take a tour of the example application

You build Angular applications with components. Components define areas of responsibility in the UI that let you reuse sets of UI functionality.

A component consists of three things:
	Details
A component class 	Handles data and functionality.
An HTML template 	Determines the UI.
Component-specific styles 	Define the look and feel.

This guide demonstrates building an application with the following components.
Components 	Details
<app-root> 	The first component to load and the container for the other components.
<app-top-bar> 	The store name and checkout button.
<app-product-list> 	The product list.
<app-product-alerts> 	A component that contains the application's alerts.
